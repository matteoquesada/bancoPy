Absolutely! Hereâ€™s a **step-by-step, beginner-friendly guide** to implementing the system described in the README. Iâ€™ll break it down into clear, actionable steps, with explanations and tips for someone new to these concepts.

---

## 1. **Prerequisites**

- **Python 3.7+** installed.  
  Check with: `python --version`
- **pip** (Python package manager).  
  Check with: `pip --version`
- **Git** (optional, for version control).
- **Basic command line skills** (cd, ls, mkdir, etc.).

---

## 2. **Project Setup**

### a. **Get the Code**

If you have the code in a zip or folder, extract it somewhere (e.g., `~/bancoPy`).  
If using Git:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd bancoPy
```

### b. **Install Dependencies**

The main dependency is Flask (for the API server):

```bash
pip install Flask
```

If you get a permissions error, try:
```bash
pip install --user Flask
```

---

## 3. **Generate SSL Certificates**

These are needed for secure (encrypted) communication between banks.

In your project directory, run:

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

- This creates `cert.pem` (certificate) and `key.pem` (private key).
- If youâ€™re on Windows and donâ€™t have `openssl`, you can [download it here](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).

---

## 4. **Initialize the Database**

The database is created automatically the first time you run either the server or API.  
But you can do it manually by running Python and calling the function:

```bash
python
>>> from db_handler import init_db
>>> init_db()
>>> exit()
```

This creates `cuentas_banco.db` with the necessary tables.

---

## 5. **Run the Socket Server**

This is the core banking server that handles inter-bank transfers.

```bash
python servidor.py
```

- It will start a secure socket server (for inter-bank comms) and show a menu for account management.
- You can use the menu to create accounts, deposit, withdraw, etc.

---

## 6. **Run the API Server**

This provides a web API for account management and transfers.

```bash
python api_server.py
```

- By default, it runs on `http://localhost:8000`.
- You can test it with tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl`.

---

## 7. **Test the System**

### a. **Create an Account (via API)**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"account_number": "12345", "nombre": "Juan Perez", "saldo": 1000, "phone_number": "88889999"}'
```

### b. **Deposit Money**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/deposit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"account_number": "12345", "monto": 500}'
```

### c. **Withdraw Money**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/cashout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"account_number": "12345", "monto": 200}'
```

### d. **List Accounts**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/list_accounts
```

### e. **Inter-bank Transfer (via API)**

Youâ€™ll need to set up two banks (run two servers on different ports, with different certs and configs) for a real test.  
But you can simulate by running two copies of the server on different ports and using the `/transfer_interbank` endpoint.

---

## 8. **Check Logs and Transactions**

- **Application logs** are in the `logs/` folder (e.g., `banco_servidor.log`, `banco_api_server.log`).
- **Transaction logs** are in the `transactions` table in the database (`cuentas_banco.db`).  
  You can view them with a tool like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).

---

## 9. **Security Notes**

- **API Keys** are hardcoded for now. In production, use environment variables or a config file.
- **SSL**: For real deployments, use certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
- **Flask**: For production, use Gunicorn or uWSGI behind Nginx/Apache (not Flaskâ€™s built-in server).

---

## 10. **Common Problems & Tips**

- **Port already in use?**  
  Change the port in the code or stop the process using it.
- **SSL errors?**  
  Make sure `cert.pem` and `key.pem` exist and are valid.
- **Database errors?**  
  Delete `cuentas_banco.db` and re-run `init_db()` if you want to reset.

## 12. **Summary**

- **Start the server:** `python servidor.py`
- **Start the API:** `python api_server.py`
- **Use curl/Postman to interact with the API**
- **Check logs for details and errors**
- **Explore and experiment!**
